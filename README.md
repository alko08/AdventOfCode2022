# AdventOfCode2022
This is my code I used to solve the problems presented in Advent Of Code, year 2022.

To quote Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/2021/about
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
